      Heading into another 4 weeks of lockdown, after living through 4
      weeks of lockdown, I allowed myself to go to a safe social distancing, 10km park and
      waterfront to do some mental running aka: reading. I took my trustry <em> the design of everyday
        things</em> soaked in fresh air and sun whilst reading up on mental and conceptual models.
      When I looked up there was a rainbow in the far distance, whilst the warm sun rays hitting
      my skin. This polarity made me think about the polarity of mental models, and what I can
      now do to further understand this concept during user research to navigate this;
      including my own mental model whilst conducting user research - so meta!.

      I practised the 80/20 rule today - you know the <em>Pareto Principle?</em> an aphorism which says:
      <em> 80% of outcomes result from 20% of all causes for any given event. </em>
      This concept has been swelling around in my head lately, I am huge fan of working smartly,
      not harder. Because of my Leo Sun energy, I love to play, even when I'm working -
      I like to have fun doing so. Many have judged me for these, but more have been inspired by this.
      The 80/20 principle allows us to work smart and win bigger - uhm yes please. Thing is, this can
      be applied for anything - I love seeing it in Design aka the white space - I'm practising
      this everyday as a social experiment through August - let's see how this cooks up.
