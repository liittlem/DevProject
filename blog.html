      Heading into another 4 weeks of lockdown, after living through 4
      weeks of lockdown, I allowed myself to go to a safe social distancing, 10km park and
      waterfront to do some mental running aka: reading. I took my trustry <em> the design of everyday
      things</em> soaked in fresh air and sun whilst reading up on mental and conceptual models.
      When I looked up there was a rainbow in the far distance, whilst the warm sun rays hitting
      my skin. This polarity made me think about the polarity of mental models, and what I can
      now do to further understand this concept during user research to navigate this;
      including my own mental model whilst conducting user research - so meta!.
